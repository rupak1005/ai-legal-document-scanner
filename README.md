# üìü AI Legal Document Scanner

**AI Legal Document Scanner** is a powerful and intelligent web application that automates the understanding of scanned legal documents such as notices and summons. It leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR), layout analysis, NLP, and transformers like LayoutLM and DistilBART to extract, classify, and summarize legal content‚Äîpresented in an intuitive Streamlit interface.

##  Features

-  **Upload Scanned Legal Documents** (JPG, PNG)
-  **Text Extraction** using Tesseract OCR
-  **Document Classification** (Summons, Notice, Other)
-  **Layout-Aware Entity Detection** using LayoutLM
-  **Key-Value Pair Extraction** (form fields)
-  **JSON Output** of extracted entities and KV pairs
-  **Automated Document Summarization** using DistilBART
-  **Labeled Entity Visualization** on document image
-  **Download Options** for extracted data

##  Demo UI

The app is built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and includes a clean UI that:

- Shows the scanned image with bounding boxes around detected text
- Displays classified document type and key-value fields
- Provides summarized content for quick comprehension
- Allows downloading extracted data as PNG, TXT, and JSON

---

##  Use Cases

- Scanning and understanding legal notices and summons
- Auto-classifying and extracting structured data from legal forms
- Summarizing long legal texts for legal assistants or clerks
- Digitizing law firm archives efficiently
